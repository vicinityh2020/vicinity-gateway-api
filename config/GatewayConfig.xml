		to be sent. 
		
		IMPORTANT: Please take into account also the fact that another 
		timeout is in the game, the timeout of Agent connector on the remote 
		OGWAPI. If the administrator of the remote OGWAPI knows that a call to
		his/her Agent takes a long time, and subsequently sets the Agent timeout
		to 120 seconds, your 90 seconds message timeout may not be sufficient to
		cover the request. Watch the logs.

		<requestMessageTimeout>90</requestMessageTimeout>
		
		
		<!-- 
		This parameter defines how the sessions that went down should be recovered.
		A session is a connection created when individual object logs in and the
		OGWAPI tries as much as possible to keep it open. 
		
		However there are cases when the OGWAPI will give up its attempts to 
		maintain the session, e.g. when the communication with server is 
		interrupted for prolonged time (depends on engine in use). In such cases
		there usually is a need to recover the sessions after communication is 
		restored. 'Aggressiveness' of OGWAPI required to recover lost sessions is 
		scenario dependent. Following are accepted values for this parameter, 
		along with explanations:
		
		
		proactive
		
		After you log your objects in and a session will go down for some reason,
		OGWAPI will be trying hard to reconnect every 30 seconds until it succeeds 
		or until you log your objects out. It does not care if your object is 
		ready to listen to incoming requests or not. Incoming requests may 
		therefore still time out if your adapter is not ready, although it will 
		look online in the infrastructure. Good for objects that are expected 
		to be always online and will likely be ready to respond, e.g. VAS or 
		other services.
		NOTE OF CAUTION: When you are testing (or better said debugging...) your
		scenarios on two machines with identical credentials, the machine that 
		runs OGWAPI with this parameter set to 'proactive' will keep stealing
		your connection. If both of them are configured to do so, it will produce
		plenty of exceptions. 
		
		
		none
		
		The OGWAPI will not make any extra effort to recover the sessions.
		If you log your object in and the session for some reason fails, it will
		remain so until you explicitly re-log your object. This was the original
		behaviour in previous versions of OGWAPI.
		
		 
		passive
		
		This will make OGWAPI terminate (!) sessions that are not refreshed
		periodically. Refreshing a connection means calling the login method at
		least every 30 seconds by default, although this number can be altered 
		with sessionExpiration parameter. 
		Call to login method is optimised, so there is no 
		overhead and it will not attempt to actually log an object in if it already
		is. Good for integrators that like to have things under control, implement
		adapters on small end user devices or have a need to implement a kind of
		presence into their application.
		
		Default is proactive.
		
		-->
		<sessionRecovery>proactive</sessionRecovery>
		
		<!--
		When sessionRecovery is set to passive, use this to set the interval
		after which a connection without refreshing will be terminated. 
		
		Note that this can't be smaller number than 5 seconds.
		
		Default is 30 seconds.  
		-->
		<sessionExpiration>30</sessionExpiration>
		
		<!-- 
		This parameter represents a path to directory for storing data. 
		
		Default is 'data/' inside the directory where the OGWAPI is run.
		-->
		<dataDirectory>data/</dataDirectory>
		
		<!-- 
		This parameter is for debug reason.
		Default is true.
		-->
		<loadTDFromServer>true</loadTDFromServer>
		
	</general>


	<actions>
		
		<!--
		This parameter sets how long (in minutes) after successful or failed 
		execution a task's return value should be retained. In other words, if a 
		task is finished or failed, its return value will be deleted from the 
		OGWAPI after this number of minutes. This is to prevent the return
		values from piling up in the device's memory.
		
		If not set, it defaults to 1440 minutes (24 hours). 
		-->
		<timeToKeepReturnValues>1440</timeToKeepReturnValues>
		
		
		<!--
		If a task is pending to be run, how long (in minutes) it should remain in the 
		queue before being tagged as failed by timing out. This is infrastructure
		specific - if a task usually takes hours to complete, this value should 
		be set to higher number. If it takes only a few seconds,
		it usually makes no sense to wait for more than an hour. Again, it 
		highly depends on what the action is about and integrator's common sense.  
		
		Default value is 120 minutes (2 hours).
		-->
		<pendingTaskTimeout>120</pendingTaskTimeout>
		
		
		<!-- 
		Maximum number of tasks being queued in pending status, waiting to be
		run. This depends on number of objects that are connecting via this 
		gateway, and the memory size of the device it runs on. Setting a 
		limit prevents a malicious object to fill the memory with pending 
		requests. Note that is a limit per action, so if you have two
		actions that can be executed on your local object, 
		maximum number of pending tasks in memory will be twice this number.  
		
		Default is 128.  
		-->
		<maxNumberOfPendingTasks>128</maxNumberOfPendingTasks>
		
		
	</actions>

	<logging>
		<!-- 
		Set a relative or absolute (recommended) path to log file. 
		In order to differentiate among multiple log files, a '%s' can be added
		to arbitrary location in the string, which will be replaced by a time
		stamp during start. Each start of the Gateway will produce a new log file
		with a new time stamp.  
		-->
		<file>log/%s-gateway.log</file>
		
		<!--
		Set a log level - messages with severity level lower than this setting 
		will not be recorded. The list of levels in descending order is 
		following:
		
		OFF
		SEVERE
		WARNING
		INFO
		CONFIG
		FINE
		FINER
		FINEST
		
		It corresponds with the levels used by class java.util.logging.Logger,
		which the Vicinity Gateway utilises for event logging. This value can also
		be set to OFF, which will disable the logging mechanism completely. 
		-->
		<level>FINEST</level>
		
		<!-- 
		Setting this value to 'true' will cause the application to log its output
		to console, aside from logging it into file. This can be useful when 
		debugging the software. 
		
		Setting it to 'false' will suppress this behaviour, instead logging 
		events solely to log file. This is the default behaviour.
